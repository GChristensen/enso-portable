Modern build instructions:

  1. Install Python 3.8 anywhere
  2. Make sure that Python 3.8 is the default Python version accessible from command line
  3. Install pywin32 for Python 3.8 (https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)
  4. Install SCons for Python 3.8 (https://scons.org/)
  5. Install SWIG (http://www.swig.org/) and make it available through the PATH environment variable
  6. Install MSYS2/MINGW32 (https://www.msys2.org/) and make them available through the PATH environment variable
  7. Install MS Visual Studio 2017+
  8. Open MSVS Developer Console and change the current working directory to the Enso repository root
  9. Execute `mingw32-make' command (use only `mingw32-make platform' if you do not need to build cairo)

Enso Windows Readme
===================

In addition to the prerequisites outlined in the README, you need to
have the following set up to compile win32 specific libraries:

  * Python 2.5 needs to be installed at C:\Python25. 
    Compilation might also work with 2.4 and 2.6 version, but it is untested.

  * Python for Windows extensions (pywin32) module
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

  * SWIG, the Simple Wrapper Interface Generator, must be installed at
    C:\Swig.

  * SCons-win32 (Software Construction tool)
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30337&package_id=22359&release_id=632161

  * "MS Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5"
    This is freeware download of command-line tools and needed libraries
    for C++ code compilation.

Build process
=============

Let's suppose that you:

    * have Enso source code in c:\develope\enso-open-source. 
      [EDIT: the following source code is assumed: https://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Ecommunityenso/enso/community-enso/tarball/145?start_revid=145]
      There must be SConstruct and SConstruct.win32 files present.
    * installed "MS Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5" to default location, 
      so its bin directory is in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin.
    * installed SCons into default location, i.e. there is %PYTHONPATH%\Scripts\scons.bat file
    * installed SWIG into root directory, i.e. there is C:\SWIG\swig.exe file

Then:

   1. Execute "Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt". You can find shortcut in your Start menu,
      otherwise you can find it in bin directory (see above)
   2. Being in the VS command prompt, change directory to your Enso source code root directory: 
      cd c:\develope\enso-open-source.
   3. You can start build process by invoking: 
      %PYTHONPATH%\Scripts\scons.bat

Now compilation should start. You will get a long list with occasional warnings (should be OK).
If there is no error, and compilation ends with OK, you can do some checks:

    * enso\platform\win32 must contain following files:

	Keyhook.dll
	EnsoThread.lib
	libcairo-2.dll
	freetype2.dll
	AsyncEventThread.lib
	AsyncEventProcessorRegistry.dll
	AsyncEventProcessorRegistry.lib
	CLogging.dll
	CLogging.lib

    * also check that inside enso\platform\win32\cairo there is

	_cairo.pyd



TODO: This README is far from complete, and the above prerequisites
may not be all that's required; we need to expand on this.

"""
    Implements the quasimode's transparent window.

    Throughout this module, it is important to keep in mind what the
    various visual elements of the quasimode are.  Below is a mediocre
    ASCII representation of those elements:

      Description Text
      user and auto-complete text
      suggestion 1
      suggestion 2
      suggestion 3
      suggestion 4
      ...

    The number of suggestions is limited by a constant declared in the
    suggestion list module.

    Each line of text is drawn by a separate "window", meaning that
    there are actual separate transparent windows for each of them.
    This allows a performance tweak: only those windows that have text
    in them are actually drawn.

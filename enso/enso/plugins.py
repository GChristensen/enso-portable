"""
    This module provides a simple mechanism to extend Enso's
    functionality.

    A plugin is just a Python module or package with a single function
    in it, load(), which takes no parameters, and is called when the
    Enso quasimode is about to start itself.

    Plugins are specified as their fully-qualified module or package
    names in the enso.config.PLUGINS list.  For instance, if the
    plugin "mypackage.myplugin" should be loaded when Enso is started,
    then the string "mypackage.myplugin" should be added to
    enso.config.PLUGINS.

    Plugins are loaded in the order specified by enso.config.PLUGINS.

    There is currently no mechanism to unload a plugin, because
    plugins are assumed to have the same lifespan as Enso itself.  If
    a plugin needs to perform any cleanup, it should register a
    handler with Python's 'atexit' module.

    This module defines classes that can be sub-classed to implement
    commands.

    == Background ==============================================
    
    In Enso, we are ultimately attempting to transform the characters
    typed by the user (the "user text") into an action (a "command").

    In general, there are two ways of doing this.  The first is an
    absolute mapping between a unique string of characters (the
    "command name") and a distinct action (the "command").
    Technically, every single command can be implemented in this way;
    but from both the user's perspective and the developer's
    perspective, it is unwieldy to think of "fontsize 12" as a
    seperate command from "fontsize 8".

    So enters the second method of mapping user text to commands:
    commands with arguments.  For a command with arguments, the
    command name is split into its "prefix" (the part that is fixed)
    and an "argument" (that part that changes).

    So where does that leave us?  With a complex situation that cannot
    be simplified.

    == Module Description =======================================

    This module lays out four class interfaces: _CommandImpl,
    CommandObject, AbstractCommandFactory, and CommandExpression.

    The _CommandImpl is an abstract class that any command
    implementation should inherit from, i.e., a base class common to
    both CommandObject and AbstractCommandFactory.

    The CommandObject defines the interface for objects that execute a
    single command.  This object encapsulates the actual code
    associated with exactly one unique string of characters typed by
    the user.  It has methods for describing and executing the action
    corresponding to exactly one possible user text.

    The AbstractCommandFactory defines a generic interface for objects
    that implement commands with arguments, and therefore can respond
    to a range of possible user text strings.  As its name implies,
    the ultimate goal of a CommandFactory is to produce an actual
    command, in this case, a CommandObject.  The CommandFactory has
    methods for determining whether or not it can produce a command
    corresponding to some user text, as well as for producing a
    CommandObject when required.

    Finally, the CommandExpression encapsulates the form that a
    command name can take. For many commands, this will simply be the
    unique string of characters that form the command's name.  But for
    commands that can take arguments, a CommandExpression can take a
    more complicated form.

    Whereever commands are implemented, there should be an exact
    mapping between CommandExpression and _CommandImpl objects.

        actually broken.  Any "user errors", like malformed selections
        or invalid applications, should cause the command to do

    prefix in their name).

    To allow for implementation optimizations, this class has methods
    for fetching Suggestions for a given chunk of user text.  That
    way, subclasses can determine the most appropriate autocompletions
    and suggestions.  For example, a command factory implementing the

    def toXml( self ):

        Transforms the suggestion into a simple XML string.  There are
        three tags:
          <ins></ins> marks an "insertion", i.e., something added to
            the original text to make the suggestion.
          <alt></alt> marks an "alteration", i.e., a substring of the
            original string was replaced with a new substring to make
            the suggestion.
          <help></help> marks a "help" text, i.e., a string that
            indicates the suggestion should be followed by some
            additional text; this string is for the user's aid, and is
            not part of the suggestion proper.
        Anything not contained in these tags was part of the original
        text.

        NOTE: The return value does not have a "root" tag, and is
        therefore not well-formed XML.

        Here is a simple example using insertions and help text:

          >>> Suggestion( 'fo', 'foo', 'fooObject' ).toXml()
          'fo<ins>o</ins><help>fooObject</help>'

        Here is a simple example using alterations:

          >>> Suggestion( 'fog', 'foo' ).toXml()
          'fo<alt>o</alt>'

        The default implementation finds the the largest substring of
        the original text that (a) includes the first character of the
        original text and (b) is entirely contained in the suggestion.
        It then repeats this with the remainder of the original text.

        So, for instance, if our original text is 'foobar' and our
        suggestion text is 'foo the bar', the default implementation
        will first match 'foo' to part of the suggestion; at this
        point the remainder of the original text will be 'bar', which
        it will find a substring for in the suggestion text as well.
        This is shown in the following example:

          >>> Suggestion( 'foobar', 'foo the bar' ).toXml()
          'foo<ins> the </ins>bar'

        Furthermore, if there is no initial substring of the original
        text in the suggestion text (i.e., condition 'a' from above) ,
        the first character is removed from the original text and the
        algorithm proceeds as described above, marking a corresponding
        part of the suggestion string as an alteration, if
        applicable:

          >>> Suggestion( 'zzzfo', 'gfoo' ).toXml()
          '<alt>g</alt>fo<ins>o</ins>'

          >>> Suggestion( 'zzzfo', 'foo' ).toXml()
          'fo<ins>o</ins>'

        Finally, if no substring of the original text matches the
        suggestion text, the entire suggestion text is returned as an
        alteration:

          >>> Suggestion( 'zzz', 'defghi' ).toXml()
          '<alt>defghi</alt>'

        NOTE: This method is intended to be overriden by subclasses
        that have specialized ways of determining what was original
        and what was inserted or altered.

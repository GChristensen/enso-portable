def _generateArgWrapper( function, wrappedFunction ):
    """
    Given any function and a wrappedFunction of the form
    wrappedFunction(*args), creates an argument-wrapper function that
    guarantees that function's arguments will be passed into
    wrappedFunction() as a single tuple with no keyword arguments;
    furthermore, the default values of any absent arguments will be
    inserted into the tuple in their appopriate positions.

    The function is very useful for creating wrappers that memoize
    functions, because it ensures that the wrapped function's
    arguments are always passed in to the memoizing wrapper as a
    hashable data structure (a tuple) in a very consistent way. See
    the following primitive example:

      >>> timesCalled = 0
      >>> cachedResults = {}

      >>> def myFunction( a, b=1 ):
      ...   'Simple function that returns the sum of the two arguments.'
      ...   global timesCalled
      ...   timesCalled += 1
      ...   return a+b

      >>> def memoizedMyFunction( *args ):
      ...   'Simple wrapper that memoizes myFunction().'
      ...   if not cachedResults.has_key( args ):
      ...     cachedResults[args] = myFunction( *args )
      ...   return cachedResults[args]

    Note that memoizedFunction() isn't very flexible; for instance,
    calling it in two different ways that are semantically identical
    erroneously causes myFunction() to be called twice:

      >>> memoizedMyFunction( 1 )
      2
      >>> memoizedMyFunction( 1, 1 )
      2
      >>> timesCalled
      2

    Note further that the function can't be used with keyword
    arguments, partly because allowing memoizedMyFunction() to take
    keyword arguments would require us to convert a **kwargs dictionary
    into a hashable object, which is inefficient.  See the following:

      >>> memoizedMyFunction( 1, b=5 )
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      TypeError: memoizedMyFunction() got an unexpected keyword argument 'b'

    To solve these problems, let's try using _generateArgWrapper() on
    our memoized function:
    
      >>> f = _generateArgWrapper( myFunction, memoizedMyFunction )

    Now the function 'f' can be used just like myFunction():

      >>> timesCalled = 0
      >>> cachedResults = {}

      >>> f( 1, 1 )
      2
      >>> f( a=1 )
      2
      >>> f( 1 )
      2
      >>> f( a=1, b=1 )
      2

    Furthermore, note that myFunction() has still only been called
    once:

      >>> timesCalled
      1

def memoized( function ):
    """
    'Memoizes' the function, causing its results to be cached based on
    the called arguments.  When subsequent calls to function are made
    using the same arguments, the cached value is returned rather than
    calling the function to re-compute the result.  For instance:

      >>> timesCalled = 0
      >>> @memoized
      ... def addNumbers( a, b ):
      ...   global timesCalled
      ...   timesCalled += 1
      ...   return a + b

    We can show that the above function is only called once for each
    unique pair of arguments like so:

      >>> addNumbers( 50, 20 )
      70
      >>> timesCalled
      1
      >>> addNumbers( a=50, b=20 )
      70
      >>> timesCalled
      1

    Using different arguments calls the function again, of course:

      >>> addNumbers( 20, 50 )
      70
      >>> timesCalled
      2

    The memoized function cannot take any arguments that are
    non-hashable; this means that the memoized function cannot take
    dicts or lists, among others.  For instance:

      >>> @memoized
      ... def myFunc( myDict ):
      ...   myDict.update( {'bar':2} )
      ...   return myDict
      >>> myFunc( {'foo':1} )
      Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      TypeError: dict objects are unhashable

    The memoized function also cannot take a ** argument, since this
    constitutes a dict.

    This decorator should only be used on functions which have a small
    number of relatively simple input arguments, and which are called
    a fantastic number of times.

    The memoized decorator is most effective in helping performance
    when used on factory functions, as the instantiated object
    (assuming that it should only be instantiated once) can be reused
    rather than re-instantiated (effectively providing the services of
    a flyweight pool).

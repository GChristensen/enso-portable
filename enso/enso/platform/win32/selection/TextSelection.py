    Contains all the methods for dealing with text selections.
    
    Usage: Contexts.TextSelection.get() returns a TextSelection object
    ( one of AbstractTextSelection's subclasses as appropriate to the
    front application ).  The client code can then use the various
    methods of the object to get and set text.

    If nothing is selected, this module is supposed to return a TextSelection
    object containing no text.  It should NOT return None.

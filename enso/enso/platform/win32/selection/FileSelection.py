"""
    Contains methods for determining which files, if any, are selected
    in the Windows Explorer.  This module uses the Abstract Factory
    pattern common to all of the Contexts modules:
    Contexts.FileSelection.get() returns a FileSelection object ( a
    subclass of AbstractFileSelection, as appropriate to the front
    application ).
    At present, there are only two subclasses -- one for the Windows
    Explorer, and one (no-op) subclass for all other applications. 

    LONGTERM TODO: Create a subclass which can read the selected file from
    Windows Open File dialog boxen and Save File dialog boxen.

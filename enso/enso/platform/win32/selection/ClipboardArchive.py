   This module provides an object representing a clipboard state, and
   maintains a stack of these objects.  When client code wants to save
   the clipboard state, it can push a state onto the stack by calling
   ClipboardArchive.pushState().  When the client code is done messing
   with the clipboard, it can restore the most recently saved state by
   calling ClipboardArchive.popState().

    # were put on the clipboard.  This may be something we want to do

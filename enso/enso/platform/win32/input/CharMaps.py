"""
    Contains the maps that convert virtual key codes to characters.

    Each of the dictionaries maps windows vkCodes (which equals the
    ascii code, for alphanumerics) to one-character strings of the
    corresponding character.  Characters which we don't want as input
    during the quasimode have no entry in this map, and so will never
    appear in the quasimode or be part of a command name.

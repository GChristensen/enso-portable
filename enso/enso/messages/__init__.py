"""
    The Message component of the Enso user interface.

    In the context of the UI, a Message is simply some
    information that needs to be presented to the user, but which is
    not specifically requested by the user as content.  For example,
    the ever familiar "king kong is not a command" informs the user
    that the commmand name they typed is not valid.

    In the spirit of Archy, Primary Messages are messages that are
    presented to the user in a transparent overlay in a somewhat
    intrusive way.  Primary Messages disappear as soon as the user makes
    any action, such as moving the mouse or pressing a key.

    Besides these Primary Messages, Enso borrows the concept of
    non-invasive messages from such applications as Firefox and Google
    Talk.  These are called "Mini Messages".  These Mini Messages
    appear in the lower right-hand corner of the user's screen, and
    may persist for some length of time.  This is to provide the user
    with information about something that continues to be true.  For
    example, a Message might be "Launching Macromedia Fireworks",
    which tells the user tha a requested action is being worked on,
    and that message might persist until there is some other visible
    manifestation of the fact that Fireworks is being opened, such as
    a splash screen or intro window appearing.

    But the essential concept behind the design of this component is
    that a Message object simply encapsulates some piece of
    information the user may care about.  A Message may be a Primary
    Message, a Mini Message, both, or neither.  We may introduce
    additional means of providing the user access to messages in the
    long run, such as a Message Graveyard.

    A Message object starts in client code, where it is told:
      (a) what information the user should be presented with (possibly
          in different forms for different purposes),
      (b) what kind of message it is (Primary, Mini, etc.)
    Then the Message is added to the singleton Message managar, which
    is responsible for seeing that the message is displayed in all the
    appropriate ways.


    ** Message Life Cycle **

    A message begins as a chunk of text that Enso wishes to present to
    the user.  Client code creates a new Message object containing an
    XML representation of this text.  Client code also tells the
    Message object whether or not it is primary and mini, and if it is
    mini, under what conditions it should be removed.

    The Message object is given to the Message manager, which
    immediately checks whether the message should be displayed as a
    primary message.  If so, then the message is displayed as the
    primary message immediately, replacing the current primary message
    if there is one.

    If the Message object is not supposed to be displayed as a primary
    message, the message manager immediately checks to see whether it
    should be displayed as a mini message.  If so, it adds it to the
    queue of mini messages that should be displayed.  However, if it
    should be displayed as mini message, then there is some condition
    under which it should no longer be displayed as a mini message.
    If that condition is true, then the message is not added to the
    mini message queue.  At this point, the message is finished, and
    disappears.

    If the Message object is displayed as a primary message, then when
    the primary message is dismissed (key press, mouse move, etc.),
    then the Message manager checks to see whether it should also be
    displayed as a mini message.  Again, if it should be displayed as
    a mini message and the condition for its removal is not yet met,
    the message is added to the mini message queue.  Otherwise, the
    message is finished.

    Once a Message object is added to the mini message queue, it is
    displayed along with any other existing mini messages.
    Periodically, the mini message queue checks to see whether each
    mini message is finished; if so, then it removes the message from
    the display, and the message is finished.

    The moral of this story is: think of "mini" and "primary" as
    behaviors that belong to a single message, not different types of
    messages.

class Message:
    """
    The Message interface for generating user information messages.

    This class is intended to be sub-classed by client code into
    classes that have specific behaviors.  To understand what the
    various behaviors of a message mean, check the life-cycle
    description in the module documentation.

    For example, a simple message might be created like this:

      >>> class MyPrimaryMessage( Message ):
      ...     def __init__( self, text ):
      ...         Message.__init__( self,
      ...                           isPrimary = True,
      ...                           isMini = True,
      ...                           fullXml = text )
      ...         self.finished = False
      ...     def isFinished( self ):
      ...         return self.finished
      >>> myMsg = MyPrimaryMessage( "<p>Hello there!</p>" )

    Then the message manager and display classes can query
    the message object for information:

      >>> myMsg.isPrimary()
      True
      >>> myMsg.isMini()
      True
      >>> myMsg.getPrimaryXml()
      '<p>Hello there!</p>'
      >>> myMsg.getFullXml()
      '<p>Hello there!</p>'

    And we can tell the message manager when the message is done being
    a mini message, by making isMessageFinised() return True:

      >>> myMsg.isFinished()
      False
      >>> myMsg.finished = True
      >>> myMsg.isFinished()
      True

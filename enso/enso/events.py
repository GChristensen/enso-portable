"""
    The central event clearinghouse.

    Wraps the InputManager to provide event handling for the user
    interface.  User interface code, and indeed any client Python
    code, can register event responders of several types (listed
    below).  These responders can be added and removed in real time,
    allowing the user interface to respond to events differently based
    on system state; for example, a timer event handler that draws the
    quasimode might be removed when not in the quasimode, to reduce
    overhead when timer events occur and improve system performance.

    The event manager implemented here does not implement a main event
    loop; that is implemented the InputManager.  Calling the
    run method of the event manager enters a main event loop that
    calls the various on<event>() methods when events occur.  These
    methods in turn call any responder functions registered for the
    appropriate type of event.
